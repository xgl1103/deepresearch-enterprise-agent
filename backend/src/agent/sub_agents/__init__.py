"""Sub-Agent graphs that encapsulate independent phases of the research pipeline.

Each sub-agent is a self-contained LangGraph StateGraph with its own nodes and
routing logic.  Sub-agents are composed into the main orchestrator graph in
`agent.graph`.

Sub-agents:
  - ResearchAgent: query generation → parallel web search → critique loop
  - WriterAgent:   outline → draft sections → cite & polish
